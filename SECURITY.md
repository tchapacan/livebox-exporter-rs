## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please publish a [private security advisory](https://github.com/tchapacan/livebox-exporter-rs/security/advisories/new) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

We will respond within one week and follow up on weekly basis. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.
